SneakySanta is a open concept game inspired by the popular tv show squid game. The game is based on opencv and mediapipe machine learning python frameworks. OpenCV is an open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing. For our game, the Mediapipe framework was used to implement the pose detection ML solution. Additionally, we used the Pygame library in order to load the Christmas (jingle bell) song and pause/unpause it when the program is running.

The user is represented as Santa, on a mission delivering gifts down the chimney.

The rules are:

- You can only jog(move) when the music is on and the tree has a green dot on top.

- When music pauses and there is a red dot on top of the Christmas tree you must stop

- The white dot moves are you move and in order to win, the white dot must pass the finish line.

- Make sure your whole body is in the frame for the game to start.

- To play the game you must download a file from GitHub and type the command (pip install opencv-python/pip install mediapipe/pip install pygame)

. For macOS/linux follow the setup manual for mediapipe and openCV: https://google.github.io/mediapipe/getting_started/install.html
